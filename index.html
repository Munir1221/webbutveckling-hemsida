            <div class="box">  It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine 
                Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
                Hangin' pictures on my wall
                Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
                I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
                Smokin' weed in Bambu, sippin' on Private Stock
                Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
                With the hat to match
                Remember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha
                You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
                Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
                Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
                Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
                Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
                Peace to Ron G, Brucie B, Kid Capri
                Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski
                I'm blowin' up like you thought I would
                Call the crib, same number, same hood
                It's all good (It's all good)
                And if you don't know, now you know, nigga I made the change from a common thief
                To up close and personal with Robin Leach
                And I'm far from cheap
                I smoke skunk with my peeps all day
                Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
                The Moët and Alizé keep me pissy
                Girls used to diss me
                Now they write letters 'cause they miss me
                I never thought it could happen, this rappin' stuff
                I was too used to packin' gats and stuff
                Now honeys play me close like butter play toast
                From the Mississippi down to the East Coast
                Condos in Queens, indo for weeks
                Sold-out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak
                Livin' life without fear
                Puttin' five karats in my baby girl's ear
                Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
                Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school
                Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
                And it's still all good
                And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

      <span>Understand the lyrics, The song starts with a "It was all a dream" Biggie didn't have shit growing up he dropped out of high school cause he knew if he didnt put 100% in rapping he wouldnt make it anywhere but he did thats what this sonng is about, he is living up to hes dreams.</span>
