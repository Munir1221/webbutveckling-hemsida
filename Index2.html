            <div class="box">Come on, come on 
                I see no changes, wake up in the morning, and I ask myself
                Is life worth living, should I blast myself?
                I'm tired of bein' poor, and even worse I'm black
                My stomach hurts, so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
                Cops give a damn about a negro
                Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
                Give the crack to the kids who the hell cares
                One less hungry mouth on the welfare
                First, ship 'em dope and let 'em deal the brothers
                Give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other
                It's time to fight back, that's what Huey said
                Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead
                I got love for my brother, but we can never go nowhere
                Unless we share with each other
                We gotta start makin' changes
                Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers And that's how it's supposed to be
                How can the devil take a brother, if he's close to me?
                I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
                But things changed, and that's the way it is I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
                Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
                We under, I wonder what it takes to make this
                One better place, let's erase the wasted
                Take the evil out the people, they'll be acting right
                'Cause mo' black and white is smokin' crack tonight
                And only time we chill is when we kill each other
                It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
                And although it seems heaven sent
                We ain't ready, to see a black President
                It ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact
                The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks
                But some things will never change
                Try to show another way but you stayin' in the dope game
                Now tell me, what's a mother to do?
                Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you
                You gotta operate the easy way
                (I made a G today) But you made it in a sleazy way
                Sellin' crack to the kid (I gotta get paid)
                Well, hey, well, that's the way it is

     Understand the lyrics, Tupac is rapping about racism 
                and how it was growing up in the slums and that there is still no changes till today.
